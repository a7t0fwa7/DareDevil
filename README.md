### [DareDevil] Resources and Credits:

1. I learned Reflective loader implementation from watching the _[<ins>SANS Offensive WorkShop</ins>](https://www.sans.org/offensive-operations/): ['From zero to hero: Creating a reflective loader in C#'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeOCZGuVsi4)_ by [@Jean_Maes_1994](https://twitter.com/jean_maes_1994). Also thanks to him, for answering my questions in his DM, so patiently :smile:!
2. Other basics of C# mostly by googling and by following offensive tradecraft basics from _[<ins>DEFCON 29 Adversary Village</ins>](https://adversaryvillage.org/): ['Tradecraft Development in Adversary Simulations`](https://youtu.be/KJsVVEn4fFw)_ by [@fozavci](https://twitter.com/fozavci).
